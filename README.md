# Udemy_Kaggle_Data_Analysis_ProjectFinal
 Final Project for INFO 450


############################################
This Project is for my final in INFO 450.

In this project I searched and used datasets off of Kaggle. 
The data consist of Udemy Course and Customer content.

My goal for this project is to understand my strengths and weaknesses and how I can refine my skills in Data Science / Data Analysis. 
Please see my PDF to go over my findings.
Please see my juypter notebook and csv files to run and look at my code



#######Project Details! #############
INFO 450: DATA SCIENCE PROJECT

Preamble: One of the most sought-after skills in data analytics is to be able to tell a story with data. This is why you used the data visualizations, statistics, and machine learning; it was to influence business decisions. There should be plenty of domain knowledge put to use and you should convey your point in such a way that someone who has no knowledge of data analytics can understand your message. One classic way to give a presentation is with a slide show.

Your Job: Perform an original business analysis on a data set of your choosing. You are trying to solve a business problem, so if you choose a random data set, you'll need to conjure up a business need. Ie, if you use breast cancer data, maybe you want to create a use case where you work for Smillow Cancer Research Center and you are helping to find early predictors of breast cancer in their patients. The data set can come from any source as long as it is something you have not already worked on for this course.

 

This is an INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENT.

40 points total; it will be an in-class assignment grade (code) AND the take-home part of your final exam grade (presentation).

 

You must turn in a GITHUB REPOSITORY link that has:

The full data set you choose to use
The python script(s) or ipynb notebook(s) you used to analyze, visualize, and model your data (20 points)
The 5 Minute Presentation you will present to the class (20 points for presenting) in whatever format you choose (PPT, IPYNB)
FYI: Many companies look at data science/analyst project github repositories from your resume, this project could set you apart as an applicant!

 

Your code must include:

6 different visualizations of your data
1 data merge, with an explanation of why you chose the method you used (left, right, outer, inner)
2 groupby aggregations of the data
AT LEAST 2 machine learning models of your choosing
Fully commented code explaining what you are thinking/creating
Your Presentation should address:

The Problem Statement. Why are you working on this project? What is the benefit? This gives an introduction and should convey the importance of the project. It is probably best to use two slides, one for the problem, and another for the benefits of the analytics.
Methodology. Talk about how you broke the problem down and what tools you used. Explain any challenges you overcame. This is a good time to show how thorough of a job you did.
Findings/Insights. What new things did you discover? Were you able to support existing theories using statistics? How did your machine learning model perform? This is the most important part of the presentation, as it is the results of your project.
Make Recommendations. This helps put the analytics to work in the real world. You may not be the one making big business decisions, but your analytics could be what is driving them. Domain knowledge and knowledge of business operations is a real force multiplier here.
Propose Future Work. What are the next steps? Does the problem need to be revisited in the future? Can the project be improved with more work? If you were given more time and resources, is there anything that could be done better?
