# Udemy_Kaggle_Data_Analysis_ProjectFinal
 Final Project for INFO 450


############################################
This Project is for my final in INFO 450.

In this project I searched and used datasets off of Kaggle. 
The data consist of Udemy Course and Customer content.

My goal for this project is to understand my strengths and weaknesses and how I can refine my skills in Data Science / Data Analysis. 
Please see my PDF to go over my findings.
Please see my juypter notebook and csv files to run and look at my code
